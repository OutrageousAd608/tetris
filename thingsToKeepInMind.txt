ummm
first things first
blocks fall from the sky

alright I'll make a list

1. blocks fall from the sky
2. blocks can be rotated as they fall
3. blocks should have a middle block that doesnt move as it falls and the 
    rest off the parts of the block rotate around that one block that doesnt move in the x
4. blocks can be shifted left and right as they fall
5. time should ramp up
6. program does not wait for user input, it accepts whenever

alrighty, now logic and functions I should make will be up to the current Richard
that is thinking with his brain. The Richard right now had no contorl over what
the future Richard will implement.

let's start.

I am thinking of a huge 2D matrix to store the board
the different shapes will have their own classes
within these classes there will be...
    colors 
    central block location
    location of other block part of the same big block


also the blocks should not be able to be rotated if it make them overlap with other boxes
I need a system to detect if blocks become overlapped

hmmmmm
我想一想
oooooh i know

check if it overlaps with another block before change it(shift or rotate)
well that was easy

lets get to the code..

oops
some more stuff to work out
from what I understand right now, I will have to multithread this stuff up
one for getting user input, one for printing the board.
