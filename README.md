Hello gamers

welcome to tetris, but with much less features and less stimulating graphics.

tetris.cpp contains all the functions as well as the main game runner all written in the main() function.
tetris.h contains macros and class definitions.

I use a mac so maybe some of the linux commands for changing color ouput and system mode may differ, if you really want to try it but you are on a different os, please look into it yourself, a good start would just be looking at everytime the keyword "system" and "printf" are used.

Also don't forget to compile with c++20 or rather anything above c++11. If you don't know how just put "-std=c++20" and "-stdlib=libc++" into the args section in your tasks.json file.

I hope you enjoy!
