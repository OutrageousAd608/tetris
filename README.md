Hello gamers

welcome to tetris, but with much less features and less stimulating graphics.

tetris.cpp contains all the functions as well as the main game runner all written in the main() function.
tetris.h contains macros and class definitions that has set me up for success.
It made making this game a lot easier than I had intended.
I got to introduce myself to multithreaded programming while making this program (because of the need for simultaneous output while taking user input).
It lowkey reminds me of entanglement fsr, not really sure why.

I hope you enjoy!
