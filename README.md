Hello gamers

welcome to tetris, but with much less features and less stimulating graphics.

tetris.cpp contains all the functions as well as the main game runner all written in the main() function.
tetris.h contains macros and class definitions that has set me up for success.
It made making this game a lot easier than I had expected.
I got to introduce myself to multithreaded programming while making this program (because of the need for simultaneous output while taking user input).
It lowkey reminds me of entanglement fsr, not really sure why.

I use a mac so maybe some of the linux commands for changing color ouput and and system mode may differ, if you really want to try it but you are on a different os, please look into it yourself, a good start would just be looking at everytime the keyword "system" and "printf" are used.

Also don't forget to compile with c++20 or rather anything above c++11. If you don't know how just use my tasks.json file.

I hope you enjoy!
